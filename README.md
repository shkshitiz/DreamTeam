# DreamTeam

## :computer: [Click here](https://dream-team.surge.sh/) to see my live project! (API key needs to be regenerated everyday)

Dream Team is a web-app that allows the user to view summoner’s profile and their match history (MVP). This web-app will utilise the data provided by ritoAPI to generate the statistic of past 5 - 20 matches. Given time, there will be sign in/ log in feature added which then lets user to “rep” (will play again) a summoner and maybe leave a “happy” comment about their experience with that particular summoner. There will also be set of boxes regarding their performance such as: carried my team, super friendly, reads my mind (synergy, team player), etc that “1+” their profile stats. This is, so that instead of feeling discouraged after viewing their past 5 “unlucky” match history in sites like op.gg, they are greeted by their amazing “team performance”!! which hopefully encourages players not to dodge and be fired up by the amazing set of team members they’re queued up with.
